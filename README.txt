This small but fine Python Snippet requests the public IP adress (supports IPv4 and IPv6)
at myip.is and outputs the result. 

It might be useful to get your public IP adress on the command line, or even to check
whether your internet connection is working. 

USAGE : 
python ipfetch.py

Or use "ipfetch.exe" binary, available on "Releases" section of this repository.
